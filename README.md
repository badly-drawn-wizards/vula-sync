What is this?
===
A simple utility to synchronize Vula (Sakai) resources locally using gvfs and rsync. It was hastily made for my own use. As such it is the opposite of usable or elegant. The code is publicly available, but it is not for the public.

How can I (struggle to) use this?
===

1. Be a Linux user. 
2. Download stack, gvfs and rsync using your resident package manager.
3. Check out this repository and install globally with stack.
4. Read the source code in abject terror.
5. Create a config file under ~/.config/vula-sync.json after inferring its schema from the code.
5. Run vula-sync
